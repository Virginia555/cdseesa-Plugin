# CDSE Simple Plugin

Welcome to the CDAB Simple Plugin repository. 

This plugin is designed as a lightweight, web-based interface to facilitate the benchmarking of various data providers using the [Copernicus Sentinels Data Access Worldwide Benchmark Test Suite](https://github.com/esacdab/cdab-testsuite/wiki). Our primary focus with this simple plugin is to perform tests for the [Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/).

## Background

The [Copernicus Sentinels Data Access Worldwide Benchmark Test Suite](https://github.com/esacdab/cdab-testsuite/wiki) is an essential software tool used to run Test Scenarios for benchmarking various providers. Understanding the functioning of this test suite is crucial for our project. To achieve a quicker execution of these test scenarios, we have opted for a web-based interface where results can be triggered at the click of a button.

This public repository is dedicated to explaining and showcasing the codes used to operate this web-based interface efficiently.

## Test Scenarios

The chosen Test Scenarios for this plugin are **TS01**: Simple data search and single download and **TS02**: Complex data search and bulk download. These scenarios have been selected because they are the fastest, allowing us to test the download speeds of the site based on the different locations of the user's computer.

For a detailed description of these Test Scenarios, please visit the following link: [Test Scenarios Description](https://github.com/esacdab/cdab-testsuite/wiki/Test-Scenarios-Description).

## How It Works

To discover how this plugin operates, please click on **[Start the Plugin](https://github.com/Virginia555/cdse-simpleplugin/wiki)**. This link will guide you to a detailed wiki page explaining the step-by-step process of our testing tool.

## Results Visualization

The results obtained from running the plugin will be automatically visualized through a Google Sheet. Specifically, for simplicity, results will be specific to a particular Test Case. You can view the Google Sheet directly by clicking [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPkhk67xB-buh6V4EsR9-M2-cub_SreJ56ivTYjCRgk/edit#gid=0). Alternatively, you can view them tabulated within the web-based interface by clicking a button located on the main page of the application.

Additionaly users are presented with a comprehensive graph that visualizes key performance metrics. Furthermore, an interactive map displays the global distribution of users who have run the tests, highlighting the geographical spread and localized performance metrics. 


## Why a Web-Based Interface?

The decision to develop a web-based interface was driven by the need for speed and efficiency in running Test Scenarios. This interface allows for quick setup, execution, and visualization of results, optimizing the benchmarking process.
